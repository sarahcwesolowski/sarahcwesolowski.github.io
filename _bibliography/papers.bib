title = {Exploring Bayesian parameter estimation for chiral effective field theory using nucleon–nucleon phase shifts},
journal = {Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics},
abstract = {We recently developed a Bayesian framework for parameter estimation in general effective field theories. Here we present selected results from using that framework to estimate parameters with a nucleon–nucleon (NN) potential derived using chiral effective field theory (χEFT): the semi-local NN potential of Epelbaum, Krebs, and Meißner (EKM). There are many NN scattering data, up to high energies, and with rather small errors. Imposing a penalty for unnatural low-energy constants (LECs) therefore has a small effect on the fits, unless only a small fraction of the NN data is used in the fit. In contrast, we have found that including an estimate of higher orders in χEFT plays an important role in robust parameter estimation. We present two case studies where our Bayesian machinery illuminates physics issues. The first involves the EKM potential at fourth order in the χEFT expansion: the two-dimensional posterior probability density function (pdf) for the fourth-order s-wave LECs obtained from the Nijmegen PWA93 phase shifts indicates these parameters in the NN potential are degenerate. We trace this feature of the pdf to the presence of an operator in the fourth-order NN potential that vanishes on-shell. The second case study examines the stability of LEC extractions as more data at higher energies are included in the fit. We show that as long as χEFT truncation errors are properly accounted for in the parameter estimation, the LEC values extracted using our Bayesian approach are not sensitive to the maximum energy chosen for the fit. Uncorrelated and fully correlated models for the truncation errors are compared, pointing the way to the use of Gaussian processes to more generally model the correlation structure.}

title = {Bayesian parameter estimation for effective field theories},
journal = {Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics},
abstract = {We present procedures based on Bayesian statistics for estimating, from data, the parameters of effective field theories (EFTs). The extraction of low-energy constants (LECs) is guided by theoretical expectations in a quantifiable way through the specification of Bayesian priors. A prior for natural-sized LECs reduces the possibility of overfitting, and leads to a consistent accounting of different sources of uncertainty. A set of diagnostic tools is developed that analyzes the fit and ensures that the priors do not bias the EFT parameter estimation. The procedures are illustrated using representative model problems, including the extraction of LECs for the nucleon-mass expansion in SU(2) chiral perturbation theory from synthetic lattice data.}

journal = {Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics},
abstract = {The application of effective field theory (EFT) methods to nuclear systems provides the opportunity to rigorously estimate the uncertainties originating in the nuclear Hamiltonian. Yet this is just one source of uncertainty in the observables predicted by calculations based on nuclear EFTs. We discuss the goals of uncertainty quantification in such calculations and outline a recipe to obtain statistically meaningful error bars for their predictions. We argue that the different sources of theory error can be accounted for within a Bayesian framework, as we illustrate using a toy model.}

    abstract = "{The rest-frame far to extreme ultraviolet (UV) colour–redshift relationship has been constructed from data on over \\$480\\, 000\\$ quasars carefully cross-matched between SDSS Data Release 14 and the final GALEX photometric catalogue. UV matching and detection probabilities are given for all the quasars, including dependencies on separation, optical brightness, and redshift. Detection limits are also provided for all objects. The UV colour distributions are skewed redward at virtually all redshifts, especially when detection limits are accounted for. The median GALEX far-UV minus near-UV (FUV − NUV) colour–redshift relation is reliably determined up to z ≈ 2.8, corresponding to rest-frame wavelengths as short as 400 Å. Extreme UV (EUV) colours are substantially redder than found previously, when detection limits are properly accounted for. Quasar template spectra were forward modelled through the GALEX bandpasses, accounting for intergalactic opacity, intrinsic reddening, and continuum slope variations. Intergalactic absorption by itself cannot account for the very red EUV colours. The colour–redshift relation is consistent with no intrinsic reddening, at least for SMC-like extinction. The best model fit has a FUV continuum power-law slope αν, FUV = −0.34 ± 0.03 consistent with previous results, but an EUV slope αν, EUV = −2.90 ± 0.04 that is much redder and inconsistent with any previous composite value (all ≳ −2.0). The EUV slope difference can be attributed in part to the tendency of previous studies to preferentially select UV brighter and bluer objects. The weak EUV flux suggests quasar accretion disc models that include outflows such as disc winds.}",
