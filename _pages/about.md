I am a **data science manager** with a track record of leading high-impact analytics projects, delivering actionable insights, and developing technical teams. Currently, I lead a team of data scientists in balance sheet management at [Yorkshire Building Society](https://www.ybs.co.uk), focusing on mortgage pipeline and prepayment modeling to support pricing, hedging, and strategic planning.

With 15+ years of experience, I specialize in:
* Building and deploying machine learning models (Python, R, SQL, Azure)
* Designing robust forecasting & behavioral analytics for financial and healthcare sectors
* Managing and mentoring data science teams to drive efficiency and innovation
* Communicating complex data insights to stakeholders across business functions

Previously, I worked in healthcare analytics at the University of Pennsylvania and academic research in applied statistics and Bayesian modeling. I thrive at the intersection of data, strategy, and execution—turning complex datasets into business value while driving forward-thinking technical solutions.
