I'm currently a healthcare data scientist with the [University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine](https://pathology.med.upenn.edu) in Philadelphia, PA, USA. **I
am relocating to the UK and seeking full-time positions in the data science sector,
particularly in clinical research.** I don't need visa sponsorship.

Right now, I'm working with individual patient electronic health record (EHR)
data to create personalised disease predictions. I use full-stack data science
techniques to extract and process complex data (SQL and Azure Databricks),
create custom machine learning models (Python and R), put models into deployment
on Azure, and create beautiful and informative visualisations (usually with maplotlib and dash).
Everything is under version control in github or gitlab.
I am a skilled scientific programmer who has worked in a variety of architectures,
and I am happy to integrate into new development stacks.

Last but not least, I am passionate about managing projects and getting things done.
I manage one major statistical methods development project for a
Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute grant which includes regular reports and
visualization deliverables,
and perform consultation and coding for two other primary aldosteronism (PA) projects.
One project is the construction of interpretable classification models, and the other
is deploying a realtime weekly targeting model for enroling patients in a PA
prospective clinical study.
