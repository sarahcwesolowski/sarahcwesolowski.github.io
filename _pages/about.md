I have recently relocated to the United Kingdom, where I will start a position in early 2024 at [Yorkshire Building Society](https://www.ybs.co.uk) as a Data Science Behavioural Analysis & Support
Lead Manager. I was previously a healthcare data scientist at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.

As a professional data scientist, I use full-stack
techniques to extract and process complex data (SQL and Azure Databricks),
create custom machine learning models (Python and R), put models into deployment
on Azure or other custom cloud platforms, and create beautiful and informative visualisations (usually with maplotlib/plptly and dash).
Everything is under version control in github or gitlab.
I am a skilled scientific programmer who has worked in a variety of architectures,
and I am happy to integrate into new development stacks or determine new ones
depending on the business use-case. Last but not least, I am passionate about managing projects and getting things done. I have managed a variety of research and consultation projects in various fields.
