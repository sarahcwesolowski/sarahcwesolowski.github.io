Since I haven’t seen many descriptions of the process for giant breed dogs such as Great Danes, Great Pyrenees, etc., I’d like to share the results of my research and personal experience here.</p> <h2 id="facebook-groups">Facebook groups</h2> <p>Facebook groups were the place where I cobbled together most information. Check out both <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/758464704201965/?mibextid=oMANbw" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Americans moving to, and living in the UK - A helpful expat group</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/petschunnel/?mibextid=oMANbw" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">US Pets to UK via Chunnel &amp; Alternate Routes</a>. Even if you’re not doing the alternative routes, the second group is quite active with people who’ve thought about this topic a lot!</p> <h2 id="options-for-moving-your-dog-to-the-uk-from-the-us">Options for moving your dog to the UK from the US</h2> <p>First, let’s talk about the transportation options for moving dogs to the UK from the US. If you have a smaller dog, you will have more options available and they will likely be cheaper. I will describe the options I found during my research below, and focus on size restrictions as well because I was moving such a tall and heavy dog.</p> <h4 id="1-direct-cargo">1. Direct Cargo</h4> <p>All dogs (and cats) entering the UK on commercial airlines must travel as manifest cargo. This is a <em>different</em> category from checked baggage and will cost more. Read more about the distinction at the <a href="https://www.arkpetoasis.com/flying-your-pet-as-cargo-vs-excess-baggage/:~:text=If%20your%20pet%20is%20too,pets%20are%20shipped%20as%20cargo." rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ARK at JFK website</a>. There appear to be safety benefits to your pet traveling as cargo rather than checked baggage.</p> <p>Direct cargo travel seems to be the most common way that folks move their dogs to the UK. One option I explored was <a href="https://www.iagcargo.com/en/products/pets/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IAG Cargo Pets</a>, which is the cargo carrier used by British Airways. You must read the crate specifications in detail, especially if you have a giant breed dog. The size of crate required for my dog was so large that it would have needed to be a custom build. Even the largest <a href="https://www.petmate.com/petmates-sky-kennel/product/00700-surcharge" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sky Kennel 700 series</a> was not big enough to comply with the requirements.</p> <p>If you use a pet relocation company, they will most likely book you with cargo through IAG or another airline’s cargo carrier.</p> <h4 id="2-indirect-transit-via-the-eu-as-checked-baggage-or-carry-on">2. Indirect transit via the EU as checked baggage or carry-on</h4> <p>This rather creative option is for people who either want to save money by booking their dog as checked baggage, which seems to be cheaper than cargo, or those who want to travel with their small pet in-cabin as carry-on. Remember, this is because the UK requires all animals, no matter the size, to travel as cargo on commercial airlines.</p> <p>What people do is arrive in an EU country that allows the checked baggage or carry-on option, and then travel by ground or sea to enter the UK.</p> <p>The routes I’ve seen suggested are (a) fly into Dublin, then travel by ferry to the UK, (b) fly into Paris and book a pet taxi or rent a car and travel into the UK via the Chunnel, and (c) fly into Amsterdam and take a ferry or the pet taxi/ rental car Chunnel route.</p> <p>One complication of this option is that you need to comply with the EU animal entry requirements in addition to the UK ones.</p> <p>In addition to the usual commercial airlines, an airline that allows slightly larger dogs (up to 33 lb.) in-cabin is <a href="https://www.lacompagnie.com/en/plan/special-services/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">La Compagnie</a>. The easiest option with them looks like flying into Paris.</p> <h4 id="3-the-queen-mary-2-cruise-ship">3. The Queen Mary 2 cruise ship</h4> <p>If you want to travel by sea from the US to the UK, a popular option is the <a href="https://www.cunard.com/en-gb/cunard-stories/pets-on-board" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">QM2 cruise ship</a>. There are only 24 kennels on board, and I’ve seen lots of comments in Facebook groups that they book up to 2 years in advance.</p> <p>There are size restrictions on the kennels and a list of restricted breeds, which includes most giant breeds including the Great Pyrenees!</p> <p>I don’t have much else to say, but you apparently are allowed as much baggage as you want. Like, you can bring 20 or 40 bags or whatever which may help with a transatlantic move!</p> <h4 id="4-k9-jets">4. K9 Jets</h4> <p>The option I used was <a href="https://www.k9jets.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">K9 Jets</a>, which is a relatively new private charter company that specifically caters to people traveling with dogs. They do also allow cats on board. Because they are a private airline, pets may travel in cabin into the UK unlike on the commercial airlines. K9 Jets has no size restrictions on dogs.</p> <p>I used the route from NJ Teterboro to London Farnborough airport. The one-way airfare was a whopping approximately $9000. With each ticket, you may take 2 dogs under 50 lb. or one dog over.</p> <p>The reason I chose this option was that my dog is reactive and can be aggressive in high-pressure situations, and I didn’t want him to bite anyone in transit as cargo. Also, animals traveling as cargo are not allowed any sedation medication, but on K9 Jets you can do this. I gave him (under guidance of our vet, of course) trazodone and gabapentin and it helped with his extreme nervousness. He is also muzzle-trained and wore his <a href="https://companyofanimals.com/uk/brand-product/baskerville-ultra-muzzle/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Baskerville brand muzzle</a> most of the journey for safety.</p> <p>Yet another reason I chose K9 Jets was the high cost of cargo transit anyway, because he needed such a large custom crate and specific ground transportation that could accommodate that crate. I received quotes of around $7500 from the pet relocation companies not including my own ticket, so I didn’t end up spending that much more.</p> <h4 id="5-self-organized-private-charter-usually-with-a-group-of-other-people">5. Self-organized private charter (usually with a group of other people)</h4> <p>Like K9 Jets but self-organized, you can book a private charter jet with likeminded folks to travel from the US to the UK. It is a bit more risky in my mind because you are relying on a group of other people, and I think it would probably be similar in cost to K9 Jets.</p> <p>I think these charters are typically organized through Facebook groups, but there may be other venues where folks organize them.</p> <h2 id="pet-taxis-for-ground-transport">Pet taxis for ground transport</h2> <p>There appear to be many pet taxis in the both the US and UK to transport your dog from point A to B. I used Happy Saluki and had a great experience! As I find out more I can list them here.</p> <h2 id="pet-relocation-companies">Pet relocation companies</h2> <p>The benefit of using a pet relocation company is that they help with the logistics of getting your pet to the airport, from the destination airport, and the vet paperwork. Their institutional knowledge seems helpful to me, but you’ll pay a premium to work with them compared to directly booking yourself.</p> <p>I didn’t end up using any, so I have no specific recommendations, but I may come back and at least list some that are available.</p> <h2 id="veterinary-paperwork-its-time-sensitive-and-stressful">Veterinary paperwork (it’s time-sensitive and stressful)</h2> <p>To be filled in.</p> <h2 id="more-about-k9-jets-and-getting-to-the-right-place-at-teterboro">More about K9 Jets and getting to the right place at Teterboro</h2> <p>To be filled in.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2023 Sarah Wesolowski.
