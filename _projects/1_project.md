I moved my 120 lb Great Pyrenees, Noah, to the United Kingdom from the United States
in December of 2023. Since I haven't seen many descriptions of the process for
giant breed dogs such as Great Danes, Great Pyrenees, etc., I'd like to share
the results of my research and personal experience here.

## Facebook groups

Facebook groups were the place where I cobbled together most information.
Check out both [Americans moving to, and living in the UK - A helpful expat group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/758464704201965/?mibextid=oMANbw) and [US Pets to UK via Chunnel & Alternate Routes](https://www.facebook.com/groups/petschunnel/?mibextid=oMANbw). Even if
you're not doing the alternative routes, the second group is quite active with people
who've thought about this topic a lot!

## Options for moving your dog to the UK from the US

First, let's talk about the transportation options for moving dogs to the UK from the US.
If you have a smaller dog, you will have more options available and they will likely
be cheaper. I will describe the options I found during my research below, and focus on
size restrictions as well because I was moving such a tall and heavy dog.

#### 1. Direct Cargo

All dogs (and cats) entering the UK on commercial airlines must travel as manifest cargo.
This is a *different* category from checked baggage and will cost more. Read more about the distinction at the [ARK at JFK website](https://www.arkpetoasis.com/flying-your-pet-as-cargo-vs-excess-baggage/:~:text=If%20your%20pet%20is%20too,pets%20are%20shipped%20as%20cargo.). There appear to be safety benefits to your pet traveling as cargo rather than checked baggage.

Direct cargo travel seems to be the most common way that folks move their
dogs to the UK. One option I explored was [IAG Cargo Pets](https://www.iagcargo.com/en/products/pets/),
which is the cargo carrier used by British Airways. You must read the crate specifications in detail, especially if you have a giant breed dog. The size of crate required for my dog was so large that it would have needed to be a custom build. Even the largest [Sky Kennel 700 series](https://www.petmate.com/petmates-sky-kennel/product/00700-surcharge) was not big enough to comply with the requirements.

If you use a pet relocation company, they will most likely book you with cargo through IAG or another airline's cargo carrier.

#### 2. Indirect transit via the EU as checked baggage or carry-on

This rather creative option is for people who either want to save money by booking their dog
as checked baggage, which seems to be cheaper than cargo, or those who want
to travel with their small pet in-cabin as carry-on. Remember, this is because the UK
requires all animals, no matter the size, to travel as cargo on commercial airlines.

What people do is arrive in an EU country that allows the checked baggage or carry-on
option, and then travel by ground or sea to enter the UK.

The routes I've seen suggested are (a) fly into Dublin, then travel by ferry to the UK,
(b) fly into Paris and book a pet taxi or rent a car and travel into the UK via the Chunnel, and (c) fly into Amsterdam and take a ferry or the pet taxi/ rental car Chunnel route.

One complication of this option is that you need to comply with the EU animal entry
requirements in addition to the UK ones.

In addition to the usual commercial airlines, an airline that allows slightly larger
dogs (up to 33 lb.) in-cabin is [La Compagnie](https://www.lacompagnie.com/en/plan/special-services/). The easiest option with them looks like flying into Paris.

#### 3. The Queen Mary 2 cruise ship

If you want to travel by sea from the US to the UK, a popular option is the [QM2 cruise ship](https://www.cunard.com/en-gb/cunard-stories/pets-on-board). There are only 24 kennels
on board, and I've seen lots of comments in Facebook groups that they book up to 2
years in advance.

There are size restrictions on the kennels and a list of restricted breeds, which
includes most giant breeds including the Great Pyrenees!

I don't have much else to say, but you apparently are allowed as much baggage as you
want. Like, you can bring 20 or 40 bags or whatever which may help with a transatlantic
move!


#### 4. K9 Jets

The option I used was [K9 Jets](https://www.k9jets.com), which is a relatively new
private charter company that specifically caters to people traveling with dogs. They
do also allow cats on board. Because they are a private airline, pets may travel in
cabin into the UK unlike on the commercial airlines. K9 Jets has no size restrictions
on dogs.

I used the route from NJ Teterboro to London Farnborough airport. The one-way airfare
was a whopping approximately $9000. With each ticket, you may take 2 dogs under 50 lb. or one dog over.

The reason
I chose this option was that my dog is reactive and can be aggressive in high-pressure
situations, and I didn't want him to bite anyone in transit as cargo. Also, animals
traveling as cargo are not allowed any sedation medication, but on K9 Jets you can
do this. I gave him (under guidance of our vet, of course) trazodone and gabapentin and
it helped with his extreme nervousness. He is also muzzle-trained and wore his
[Baskerville brand muzzle](https://companyofanimals.com/uk/brand-product/baskerville-ultra-muzzle/) most of the journey for safety.

Yet another reason I chose K9 Jets was
the high cost of cargo transit anyway, because he needed such a large custom crate and
specific ground transportation that could accommodate that crate. I received quotes of
around $7500 from the pet relocation companies not including my own ticket, so I didn't end up spending that much
more.

#### 5. Self-organized private charter (usually with a group of other people)

Like K9 Jets but self-organized, you can book a private charter jet with likeminded
folks to travel from the US to the UK. It is a bit more risky in my mind because you
are relying on a group of other people, and I think it would probably be similar
in cost to K9 Jets.

I think these charters are typically organized through Facebook groups, but there
may be other venues where folks organize them.

## Pet taxis for ground transport

There appear to be many pet taxis in the both the US and UK to transport your dog
from point A to B. I used Happy Saluki and had a great experience! As I find out more
I can list them here.

## Pet relocation companies

The benefit of using a pet relocation company is that they
help with the logistics of getting your pet to the airport, from the destination airport, and
the vet paperwork. Their institutional knowledge seems helpful to me, but you'll pay a premium to work with them compared to directly booking yourself.

I didn't end up using any, so I have no specific recommendations, but I may come
back and at least list some that are available.
